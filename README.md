# Locality Dependent Gesture-based Smart Home Control System Using Bluetooth Technology on a SmartWatch

A gesture-based control system is developed that implements real-time gesture recognition on an off-the shelf smartwatch with indoor localization relying on Bluetooth technology. The algorithms for gesture detection and Bluetooth RSSI based localization run locally on the smartwatch and eliminate the need for data to be offloaded to a server or smartphone for doing the computations.
The system comprises two functions to create an intelligent smart home system: (1) a hand gesture-based control system that enables a real-time hands-free interaction and (2) an indoor localization system that relies on RSSI based BLE technology for both location sensing and device to device (D2D) communication.
